Building a web app infused with machine learning is the wave of the future. Now that you have scaffolded a web app that performs as a PWA, you can feed it all kinds of interesting machine learning models. These models could be trained on Custom Vision AI services or elsewhere. Try to build a web app using a different JavaScript framework using this same technique, and try training machine learning models with different methodologies.
